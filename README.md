## üì± Live Demo

üëâ [Live Demo on Render](https://finalproject-frontend-d2e7.onrender.com/)

*The app is currently designed mobile-first based on the iPhone 12 Pro screen size, but it is not yet fully responsive. Due to some issues detected on iPhones, we recommend using the app on a desktop browser with device emulation set to iPhone 12 Pro for the best experience. Improvements to responsiveness and mobile compatibility are planned for future iterations.*

## üöÄ Getting Started

The app is deployed and ready to use at:  
üëâ **[https://finalproject-frontend-d2e7.onrender.com/](https://finalproject-frontend-d2e7.onrender.com/)**

> To run the project locally, create `.env` files in both backend and frontend folders as follows:

*Note: You will need to create accounts and generate your own API keys/secrets for MongoDB, RapidAPI, Gemini AI, and Cloudinary. These must be set in your local .env file before running the backend.*

### Backend `.env` (in `/backend`)

    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
    SPA_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
    RAPIDAPI_KEY=<your_rapidapi_key_for_exercisedb>
    RAPIDAPI_HOST=exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com
    GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>

### Frontend `.env` (in `/frontend`)

    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

Then install dependencies and run both servers:

    # Backend
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev

    # Frontend
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
